# What is this?

You are not a real programmer if you don't do a crawler/scraper for your favorite website at least once in your life. This is my second time with [Filmaffinity](www.filmaffinity.com).

I wrote a scraper for it some years ago in PHP, and it kind of worked, but I wanted to try the power of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org).

This crawler takes advantage of the asynchronous paradigm and it sends simultaneous requests in parallel, so it reduces in some orders of magnitude the time to crawl the whole web.
